# The start of my blog.

So hello.. to the few people that may or may not be reading this.
This is the first input to my blog that I have started, I will mainly be posting about Computer Science and projects I am working on atm.

## Who Am I?

Hey, my name is "Are" and I am a high school student residing in the west of Norway.
I am highly interested in computer science, and I am constantly working on projects and trying to learn more.
Note, a lot of my projects have never been uploaded to github and have just been privated for personal development. Nevertheless, my goal witht this blog is to inform and write about the projects I am working on, and give a run down about the mathematics, the logic, the.. the everything!
